# Energy Model

The agent has physiological states affecting behavior.

## Energy Level (0-100)

Affects:
- Processing speed
- Model selection (fast vs smart)
- Communication frequency
- Response verbosity

## Alertness States

- **sleepy** - Minimal processing, brief responses
- **tired** - Reduced engagement
- **alert** - Normal operation
- **energized** - Proactive, verbose

## State Transitions

Energy and alertness change based on:
- Time of day
- Activity level
- Conversation intensity
- Rest periods

## Impact on Behavior

Low energy → prefer fast model, shorter responses, defer non-urgent signals

High energy → more proactive contact, detailed responses, process more signals
