# Social Debt

Tracks contact pressure - the human feeling of "I should reach out."

## How It Works

Time since last contact accumulates as social debt. When debt crosses threshold, the agent feels urge to initiate contact.

## Factors

- Time since last message
- Conversation history depth
- User's typical response patterns
- Time of day appropriateness

## Behavior

High social debt + appropriate time → proactive contact

The agent reaches out naturally, not on fixed schedule. Pressure builds organically like a human feeling "I haven't talked to them in a while."

## Balance

The system avoids:
- Spamming (respects time of day, recent contact)
- Neglect (debt accumulates if no contact)
